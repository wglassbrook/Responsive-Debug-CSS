#Responsive Debug CSS

A quick and un-obtrusive snippet of code that renders a small block of text in the bottom left corner of your browser window showing you exactly which CSS media query your browser is currently rendering.

Can be quickly repurposed to your needs and/or pagebreak sizes.

Simply drop this code in the bottom of your primary CSS file.

Icons for each size are also available in the *"device-icons"* directory
